# Web-Dev-Projects
A repository containing my Web Development projects

This repository contains the web development projects I have worked on so far. Today is the 4th of November, 2023 and I only recently started working on my own personal projects a few months ago after leaving my last job so I do not have a lot of them right now, however my portfolio will continue to grow with time. Feel free to check out this repository and all my other repositories so that you can see all my other works. If you want to access the web projects, clone them and navigate to the project directory in your command line and run npm start. That should set up the project to be run locally for you. However for the weather watch project the web page might not show up. If that is the case then it means that my open weather api is no longer active due to monetary issues. In that situaation if you already have an openweather paid api key then you can goahead and follow the steps below. 
1. Create a .env.local file in the project root directory. That should be directly in the weather-watch directory.
2. Create a variable called REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY and let it = your api key.
3. The app should then run smoothly and you can enjoy your weather forecast

If you do not have the key then you might need to be a bit patient for me to either officially host the web site or wait for me to create a free version of the app. However this repository was created as part of my portfolio for those interested in recruiting me or reaching out to me with an opportunity, so I believe that those who can read code will still be able to gauge my abilities and skill level from the source code of the app.
Enjoy my portfolio !!!
